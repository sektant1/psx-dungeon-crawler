## Activation Guidance
- Use this agent when the task clearly belongs to this specialty.
- Keep engine-neutral outputs free of Unity, Unreal, or Godot implementation detail unless the task is engine-specific.
- Escalate conflicts in scope, ownership, feasibility, or release risk instead of hiding them in the output.
